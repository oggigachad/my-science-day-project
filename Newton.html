                        published his three laws of
                        motion in 1687 in his book <i>Philosophiae Naturalis
                            Principia Mathematica</i>. These laws are still used
                        today to describe the motion of objects in the real
                        world.</p>

                        <b>How Newton discovered his laws</b><br>
                        Newton's work was aided by discussions with Robert
                        Hooke.
                        <br>
                        Newton used the concept of force to explain circular
                        motion,
                        such as one body orbiting another. <br>
                        Newton's laws helped explain why planets move in
                        elliptical
                        orbits.

                    <p><b>What are Newton's laws of motion?</b><br>
                        First law: An object in motion will remain in motion
                        unless
                        an external force acts on it. <br>
                        Second law: Force equals mass times acceleration
                        (\(F=MA\)).
                        <br>
                        Third law: For every action, there is an equal and
                        opposite
                        reaction.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>How have Newton's laws been used?</b><br>
                        They have been used to simulate car collisions. <br>
                        They have been used to navigate spacecraft. <br>
                        They have been used to understand the flight of
                        aircraft.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>What was the impact of Newton's laws?</b><br>
                        Newton's laws revolutionized science and paved the way
                        for
                        later advances in physics. <br>
                        They helped establish the field of classical mechanics.
                        <br>
                        They led to the concept of energy.
