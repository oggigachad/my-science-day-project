                <p><b>Sir Isaac Newton</b> first published his three laws of motion in 1687 in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. These laws are still used today to describe the motion of objects in the real world. </i></p>

                    How Newton discovered his laws
                        Newton's work was aided by discussions with Robert Hooke. 
                        Newton used the concept of force to explain circular motion, such as one body orbiting another. 
                        Newton's laws helped explain why planets move in elliptical orbits. </i>

                    <b>What are Newton's laws of motion?</b> <br> First law: An object in motion will remain in motion unless an external force acts on it. Second law: Force equals mass times acceleration (\(F=MA\)). Third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

                    <b>How have Newton's laws been used?</b><br>
                    They have been used to simulate car collisions.
                    They have been used to navigate spacecraft.
                    They have been used to understand the flight of aircraft.

                    <b>What was the impact of Newton's laws?</b> <br>
                    Newton's laws revolutionized science and paved the way for later advances in physics.
                    They helped establish the field of classical mechanics.
                    They led to the concept of energy.
